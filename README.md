# shelper

Helper methods for prettier shell scripting

## Installation  

Include this line at the top of your shell script:  
`eval "$(cat ~/.local/share/shelper.sh || curl shelper.suderman.io/shelper.sh)"`  

## Methods

```

```
(has brew) && brew_prefix="$(brew --prefix)"
```

###hasnt  

Exactly the same as the previous method, but the other way around.
